# Data Model for Seven Sages Brewing Company
I created a data model and Microsoft Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing, a small company struggling to leverage their disjointed data to facilitate smart decision-making about what products to prioritize as the company continues to grow. First, I mashed together data form multiple sources with Microsoft Power BIâ€™s built-in Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool. next, I cleaned, organized, and structured the mashed data with Power Query. The cleaned and organised data was what I used to build a data model with the appropriate relationships and filters and I created a simple report using common visualizations and DAX measures.
